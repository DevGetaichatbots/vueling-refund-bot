Build a Python bot that automates the Vueling airline refund chatbot form at this URL:
https://www.vueling.com/en/we-are-vueling/contact/management?helpCenterFlow=RefundJustifiedReasons

Tech stack:
- Python 3
- Playwright (browser automation)
- playwright-stealth (anti-bot detection)

What the bot should do:
1. Open the Vueling refund chatbot page in a Chromium browser
2. Wait for the chatbot widget to fully load
3. The chatbot first asks for booking lookup - click "CODE AND EMAIL" option
4. Fill in the booking code (e.g. "EHZRMC") 
5. Fill in the email address used for booking
6. Click SEND button
7. Wait for booking verification response
8. When asked "Why do you want to cancel your booking?" - click "ILL OR HAVING SURGERY"
9. The chatbot will say refund will be as Flight Credit and ask for medical documentation
10. When asked "Got all your documents to hand?" - click "YES"
11. Upload a medical certificate file (PDF/image)
12. Submit the form
13. Take a screenshot of the confirmation as proof

Important technical notes:
- The chatbot is a JavaScript SPA - elements load dynamically after each step
- The chatbot widget might be inside an iframe - detect and handle this
- Use playwright-stealth to avoid bot detection
- Add random delays between steps (1-3 seconds) to mimic human behavior
- Use explicit waits (wait_for_selector) instead of fixed sleep times
- Add proper error handling and retry logic for each step
- Take screenshots after each step for debugging
- Run with headless=False first for testing, make it configurable

Project structure:
- main.py - main bot logic
- config.py - settings (booking code, email, file path, headless mode, delays)
- requirements.txt - dependencies (playwright, playwright-stealth)
- /screenshots/ folder - for debug screenshots

Make the bot accept these inputs:
- booking_code (string)
- email (string) 
- reason (string, default "ILL OR HAVING SURGERY")
- document_path (file path to medical certificate)

Start by setting up the project structure, installing dependencies, and writing the basic navigation + chatbot interaction flow. Use headless=False so I can watch it work and verify the correct selectors.
